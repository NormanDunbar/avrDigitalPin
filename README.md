# avrDigitalPin
This is one of the demo libraries for the article on [writing Arduino and AVR libraries](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/WritingLibraries) which I am currently writing (or have completed, depending on when you read this!). There are two libraries created for the article:

* This one, [avrDigitalPin](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/avrDigitalPin) for both Arduino and PlatformIO, in the latter case, regardless of framework; and
* [digitalPin](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/digitalPin) for the Arduino IDE only (or PlatformIO using the Arduino framework).
